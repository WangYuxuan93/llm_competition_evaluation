        "question_type": "text",
        "answer": "This fluid is a mixture of water, chemicals, and sand. The water and chemicals constitute about 0.5% of the fracturing fluid, and more than 600 synthetic chemicals are used in the process. These chemicals include methanol, napthalene, xylene, acetic acid, ammonia, and #2 fuel oil. The purpose of the fracturing fluid is to open and prop spaces in the shale to allow gas to flow into the well."
